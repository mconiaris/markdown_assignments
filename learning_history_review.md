# Reviewing My Learning History

## What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?
I have a tendency to get overly frustrated if I do not understand something right away. I also can sometimes jump ahead unneccessarily, which can cause confusion later.
## How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?
The first thing that I need to do is try to keep calm and focused. I need to remind myself that our instructions are thorough, and that I need to follow the course's train of thought.
## What learning tactics or approaches do you feel have most benefitted you as a student?
I can be tenacious when it comes to solving errors. I can assume that since the assignment was given that there is a correct answer for it, and that with finding the right information, I can find it.
## Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy.)
It's just my first day, so it's too early for me to answer that.
## What is your greatest fear as a WDI student?
That I get too far behind and I do not finish the course.
## Is this fear valid? If so, does it serve you as someone learning to program?
It's very much a possibility, with classes taking place every day. I will just have to work hard and use the resources available to me.
