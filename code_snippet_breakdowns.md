#Michael Coniaris' Code Snippet Breakdowns
1. `|` - Pipe allows you to move ("pipe") output from one command to another. I'm concerned about really getting the syntax nailed down. 
2. `touch` - This command allows you to create a new file. Remembering this command may be a challenge as the name is not intuitive. I'll just have to remember that "touching a folder" makes things happen.
3. `git add` - This prepares a file to be committed in git. I'll need more experience to learn the purpose behind the step.
4. `git commit` - This adds the version into the repository with descriptive notes. I need to learn when it's right to "add" and when it's best to "commit."
5. `git config` - This allows you to modify the preferences of git. How and what this means in practice will take some experience.
6. `./` - this is an alias for the present folder. I'm not sure what the benefit of it is though.
7. `rm -r` - This deletes a folder and all of it's content. I need to make sure that I get the syntax right and not do more damage.
8. `cat` - this creates output from a file. I do not find the name intuitve and need more practice.
9. `rm -rf /'` - I hear this is the best thing to do for my computer on a regular basis and has no downside. PJ told me so, and he's never wrong.
10. `<` - this carrot is a way to pipe output from a file/command on the right to something on the left. I'll need some practice with the syntax.
