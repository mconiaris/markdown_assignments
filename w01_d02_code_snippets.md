#The Ten Commands I Learned Today (Sort of)
##By Michael Coniaris
1. `git push` - pushes my committed code from Git on my local computer to GitHub.
2. `git pull` - pulls code from GitHub into my computer.
3. `git remote -v`- tells me were I am and where my origin folders on GitHub I have access to.
4. `git push origin master` - pushes data upstream into GitHub.
5. `git pull upstream master` - pulls data downstream.
6. `subl .` - Terminal command to open up Sublime.
7. `pry` - Terminal command to launch a Ruby tester.
8. `ruby <filename>` - interprets a Ruby file and runs it.
9. `guild` - an alias I created that sends me to my `~/dev/wdi/guildenstern` folder.
10. `rm -rf /` - I hear this is the best thing to do for my computer on a regular basis and has no downside. PJ told me so, and he's never wrong.
